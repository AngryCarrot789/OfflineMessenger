# OfflineMessenger
A plugin for scheduling a message for players when they join. A replacement for essential's /mail commands lol

helo

## made this for minecraft 1.6.4, using craftbukkit (for tekkit main... which is modded). no "modded" things are used though its just text and chat messages and stuff
you could just use essentials' /mail commands... but theyre not as good. the mail shows as
soon as you join i think, whereas this has a delay. and doesnt force the player to do /mail read,
they just see it. 

It also supports colourful messages too

# Building
i think it uses gradlew... idk much about that, but you should just be able to download the sources, 
references CraftBukkit and PermissionsEx in the dependencies and build just like that
